# Coin Game

## A game based on the logic of the popular discord bot called "Dank memer", Do let me know about what you feel about this app!

### How to play:

    As you see there are 5 buttons namely Search, Borrow, Balance, Shop and Go.

    Search allows you to earn coins by searching in a specific area, 
    once you click the button, 
    3 options will appear on the BROWN text view/Bar.

    Type in the choice in the text box on the left of the “Go” button from where you want to search and click “Go”.

    You will receive coins after pressing the go button.

    Borrow has pretty much the same purpose but you will not get an option where you can choose where or 
    whom to borrow from, you will be given a an amount after clicking the button.

    Balance as the name suggests tells you the current balance which you have.

    Shop will open a screen where you will see a list of items which you can buy, 
    after reading the options please type in your choice in the text box on the left of the “Go” button, 
    after entering your choice click the Go button to complete your purchase.

    You will not be able to search and borrow constantly, there will be. 
    Time delay of a few seconds before searching again.
